# Angular4

This repository contains working examples of basic topis of Angular 4. I have tried to keep it as simple as possible to make it easy to understand by freshers, who have just started learning Anguar 4. 

I have not used much `css` or `material.io` to keep it more clean for newbies.

You can refer https://codecraft.tv/assets/books/angular-from-theory-to-practice.pdf to get better understanding if you are new to this. It's a free pdf file. :) Cheers !
